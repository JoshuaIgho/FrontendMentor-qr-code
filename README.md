## Overview
The QR Code Component project is a simple yet elegant frontend challenge designed to enhance my proficiency in HTML and CSS. The primary objective of this project is to create a visually appealing QR code card that serves as an interactive element, allowing users to scan the code and access a specific link. This component mimics a real-world scenario where businesses and individuals use QR codes for seamless redirection to websites, promotional pages, or digital resources.

This project not only tests my ability to structure content effectively using semantic HTML but also pushes me to refine my CSS styling techniques to achieve a well-balanced and modern design. The challenge emphasizes layout composition, responsive design, and typography, all of which are fundamental skills in frontend development.

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
Building the QR Code Component as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge was a great opportunity to refine my HTML and CSS skills. Even though it was a relatively simple project, it reinforced key frontend concepts and improved my overall approach to layout, styling, and responsiveness.

1Ô∏è‚É£ HTML Structure & Semantics
Learned how to properly structure a minimal, accessible component using semantic HTML.
Used a container div to wrap the QR code and text content in a logical layout.


2Ô∏è‚É£ CSS Layout & Positioning
Practiced using CSS Flexbox to center the QR code component both vertically and horizontally.
Learned how margin, padding, and border-radius affect layout and spacing.
Understood how to use max-width to prevent elements from stretching too much on larger screens.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Responsive Design (Mobile-Friendly Layout)
Used CSS Media Queries (@media (max-width: 375px)) to ensure the component scales well on mobile.
Learned how to adjust font sizes and padding dynamically for different screen sizes.

Final Thoughts üöÄ
This project may have been simple, but it provided valuable practice in HTML, CSS, layout techniques, and responsive design. The key lessons I take away from this challenge are:
‚úîÔ∏è Good structure and clean HTML make styling easier.
‚úîÔ∏è Flexbox is essential for centering and layout control.
‚úîÔ∏è A mobile-first approach ensures a better user experience.

I‚Äôm excited to apply these learnings to more complex projects as I continue improving my frontend development skills! üé®üíª




### Continued development

As I progress in my frontend development journey, I want to **deepen my understanding of JavaScript** before fully diving into **React and React Native**. Strengthening my core JavaScript skills will provide a solid foundation for working with modern frameworks like **Next.js**, which is essential for building **optimized, server-rendered applications**.  

Key Focus Areas:
1. **Mastering JavaScript Concepts** ‚Äì Improving my understanding of **ES6+, asynchronous programming, and data structures**.  
2. **React Fundamentals** ‚Äì Learning **React hooks, state management, and component lifecycle**.  
3. **React Native** ‚Äì Exploring mobile development to build cross-platform apps.  
4. **Next.js** ‚Äì Leveraging its features like **server-side rendering (SSR)** and **static site generation (SSG)** for better performance.  

By refining these skills, I‚Äôll be well-equipped to build **scalable, high-performance web and mobile applications**. üöÄ
